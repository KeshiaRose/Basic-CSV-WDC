# Basic CSV Web Data Connector

This is a simple [Web Data Connector](https://tableau.github.io/webdataconnector/docs/) for CSVs hosted on the web.

## How to use

1. Start a new WDC connection in Tableau Desktop 2019.4 or higher and enter: https://basic-csv-wdc.herokuapp.com/
1. Enter your CSV URL.
1. Advanced options: Change the HTTP method, delimiter, encoding, or add a Bearer token.
1. Decide which mode to use (Loose Typed recommended).
1. Click **Get Data!**

## Advanced options

This WDC allows some additional customizations that can be found by clicking on "Advanced +".

**Method**: The default method to fetch the CSV file is GET but you can change this to POST if needed.

**Bearer token**: If your CSV is protected with a bearer token you may add it and it will be included with the request to fetch your CSV.

**Custom delimiter**: If your text file is separated by something other than a comma you can set your own custom delimiter.

**Encoding**: If your CSV file uses a specific encoding other than utf-8 you may set it here. You can find a list of supported encodings [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder/encoding).

## How to refresh

Note that this will require your Tableau Server to restart!
